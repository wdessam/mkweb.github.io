	<h1>Valentine</h1>
	<br><h2>What is Valentine now a day?</h2></br>
	<p> <b>Each year on February 14th, many people exchange cards, candy, gifts or flowers with their special valentine. The day of romance 
	we call Valentineâ€™s Day is named for a Christian martyr and dates back to the 5th century, but has origins in the Roman holiday Lupercalia</b></p>
    <br><h2>What is real Valentine ?</h2></br>
	<p> <b>Saint Valentine, officially known as Saint Valentine of Rome, is a third-century Roman saint widely celebrated on February 14 and commonly associated with "courtly love."

Although not much of St. Valentine's life is reliably known, 
and whether or not the stories involve two different saints by the same name is also
 not officially decided, it is highly agreed that St. Valentine was martyred and then buried on the Via Flaminia to the north of Rome.

In 1969, the Roman Catholic Church removed St. 
Valentine from the General Roman Calendar,
 because so little is known about him. However, 
 the church still recognizes him as a saint, listing him in the February 14 spot of Roman Martyrolgy.

The legends attributed to the mysterious saint are as inconsistent as the actual identification of the man.

One common story about St. Valentine is that in one point of his life, as the former Bishop of Terni, 
Narnia and Amelia, he was on house arrest with Judge Asterius. 
While discussing religion and faith with the Judge, Valentine pledged the validity of Jesus. The judge immediately put Valentine and his faith to the test.
